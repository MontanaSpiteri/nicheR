\description{
Find niches of commonly co-occurring cell types in spatial transcriptomics or proteomics data.
}
\details{
`find_niches` uses the cell type positions and provided cell type annotation as input to identify niches of
commonly co-occurring cell types. `find_niches` works using a window approach. First each FOV, if applicable, or the entire region
are divided into overlapping windows of size `tile_height` times `tile_height`. These windows shifted by `tile_shift` in x and y
direction resulting in overlaps. In each window, we count the number of different cell types.
Using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity implemented a hierarchical clustering tree is built, which can be used to determine `num_clusters`
niches. For each `tile_shift` by `tile_shift` tile of each region is overlapped by multiple windows with
an associated niche label used to determine the probability of each tile to be a member of a certain niche or using
a majority voting strategy to identify a niche label. Note that edges of FOVs or entire regions are expanded to avoid edge effects. Hence, for
FOVs that are adjacent treat them like one continuous region.
